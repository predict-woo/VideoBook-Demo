00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,520
Over the years that I've been making videos, I've visited quite a few strange elevators and lifts.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:13,000
And every time I do, I get emails from people in Germany, saying "what about the one in the New Town Hall in Hanover?"

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,020
And look, I don't want to become 'that weird elevator guy', but... I finally made it.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,080
This New Town Hall is the only one in the whole of Germany with a dome.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,560
That's the first specialty, and another one is, of course, our curved elevator.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
That's the only one in the world.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,800
The elevator was opened in 1913, at the same time as this building was finished.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:46,040
They didn't want to change the design of this building, otherwise they had to install this elevator just in the middle of the main hall.

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:55,080
So they found one spot on this building, one small tower, and the elevator follows the form of the cupola.

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,520
It starts in the third floor of this building, 42 meters high, 8.3 meters sideways.

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,840
This elevator technik was developed during the construction of this building.

12
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,960
Elevators were already fairly common in high buildings by the time this was constructed, but this elevator has a unique design requirement.

13
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,120
It means to travel up the side of a dome.

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,320
The whole elevator shaft is curved.

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,240
It's not a diagonal straight line like the Eiffel Tower lifts.

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,400
The track bends as it goes up, about 17Â°.

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,880
And it doesn't bend evenly. It's not a smooth curve.

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,040
The path the elevator takes is irregular and lumpy.

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
That would be a design challenge today, let alone a century ago.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,240
The new elevator was built by the company Lutz from Hamburg.

21
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:50,320
You cannot use this elevator the whole year, because in the winter it's very slippery there on the dome.

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,720
So each spring, there are many Hanover people who cannot wait to see again Hanover from above.

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:04,600
The various parts and mechanisms of the original lift were replaced over the years, and in 2007, what was left was ripped out.

24
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,360
A few months later, this brand new elevator was completed.

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,120
And it only just fits.

26
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,000
At points, there's only 5mm of clearance between the cabin and the wall.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,600
At other places, there's lots more.

28
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,720
Apparently, during testing and construction, it did bump and scrape the walls sometimes.

29
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,940
Like I said, the path is lumpy.

30
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,080
Oh, and also, the floor panels of this new lift? They can be transparent.

31
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,880
Obvious question: how do they keep the cabin vertical as it goes up?

32
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,200
I assumed this would have some kind of clever self-levelling mechanism, like a funicular railway, or the tram at Gateway Arch in St Louis.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,840
Or maybe a floor with hydraulics in it, so it would stay level as the cabin moved around it.

34
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,920
But no. The solution is simple. They don't keep the floor level!

35
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,040
The whole cabin is just dragged up the side as one.

36
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
I can't lean on these doors, but I want to.

37
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,680
I'm leaning on this pole.

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,040
We started out on the ground at a slight angle, passed through vertical about halfway up, and we ended up leaning a little bit the other way.

39
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,880
Because a floor with a tilt of a few degrees isn't really a big problem for a short journey.

40
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,840
So there you go. Germany, you can stop emailing me.

41
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,428
I have finally taken a trip on your elevator.

42
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,059
For a video about an elevator ride, that was a lot of steps.
