00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,040
Over the years that
I've been making videos,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,520
I've visited quite a few strange
elevators and lifts.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,640
And every time I do,

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,680
I get emails from
people in Germany,

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,000
saying "what about the one in
the New Town Hall in Hanover?"

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,240
And look, I don't want to become
'that weird elevator guy', but...

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,020
I finally made it.

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,080
- This New Town Hall is the only one
in the whole of Germany with a dome.

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,320
That's the first specialty,

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,560
and another one is, of course,
our curved elevator.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
That's the only one in the world.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,240
The elevator was opened in 1913,

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,800
at the same time as
this building was finished.

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,160
They didn't want to change the
design of this building,

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,960
otherwise they had
to install this elevator

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,040
just in the middle
of the main hall.

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,720
So they found one spot
on this building,

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,120
one small tower,

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,080
and the elevator follows the
form of the cupola.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,160
It starts in the third floor
of this building,

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,520
42 meters high,
8.3 meters sideways.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,440
This elevator technik
was developed

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,840
during the construction
of this building.

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,320
- Elevators were already fairly
common in high buildings

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,880
by the time this
was constructed,

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,960
but this elevator has a
unique design requirement.

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,120
It means to travel up
the side of a dome.

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,320
The whole elevator shaft is curved.

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,240
It's not a diagonal straight line
like the Eiffel Tower lifts.

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,400
The track bends as it goes up,
about 17Â°.

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,880
And it doesn't bend evenly.
It's not a smooth curve.

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,040
The path the elevator takes
is irregular and lumpy.

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
That would be a design challenge today,
let alone a century ago.

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,240
The new elevator was built by
the company Lutz from Hamburg.

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,120
You cannot use this elevator
the whole year,

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,960
because in the winter

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,320
it's very slippery
there on the dome.

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,840
So each spring, there are
many Hanover people

39
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,720
who cannot wait to see again
Hanover from above.

40
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,960
- The various parts and mechanisms
of the original lift

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,320
were replaced over the years,

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,600
and in 2007, what was left
was ripped out.

43
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,360
A few months later, this brand new
elevator was completed.

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,120
And it only just fits.

45
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,000
At points, there's only 5mm of clearance
between the cabin and the wall.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,600
At other places, there's lots more.

47
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,800
Apparently, during testing
and construction,

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,720
it did bump and scrape
the walls sometimes.

49
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,940
Like I said, the path is lumpy.

50
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,200
Oh, and also, the floor panels
of this new lift?

51
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,080
They can be transparent.

52
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,120
Obvious question:

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,880
how do they keep the cabin
vertical as it goes up?

54
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,760
I assumed this would have

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,920
some kind of clever
self-levelling mechanism,

56
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,200
like a funicular railway, or the
tram at Gateway Arch in St Louis.

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,040
Or maybe a floor with
hydraulics in it,

58
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,840
so it would stay level
as the cabin moved around it.

59
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,920
But no. The solution is simple.
They don't keep the floor level!

60
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,040
The whole cabin is just
dragged up the side as one.

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
I can't lean on these doors,
but I want to.

62
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,680
I'm leaning on this pole.

63
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,800
We started out on the ground
at a slight angle,

64
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,360
passed through vertical
about halfway up,

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,040
and we ended up leaning
a little bit the other way.

66
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,760
Because a floor with a tilt
of a few degrees

67
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,880
isn't really a big problem
for a short journey.

68
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,840
So there you go. Germany,
you can stop emailing me.

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,428
I have finally taken a
trip on your elevator.

70
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,080
For a video about
an elevator ride,

71
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,059
that was a lot of steps.
